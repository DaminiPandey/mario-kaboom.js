<h1>Super Mario Bros using JavaScript and kaboom.js 💥</h1>


<p>This is a game of Super Mario Bros made using javascript and javascript gaming library called Kaboom.
Kaboom is a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun.
For the sake of simplicity I've added only two levels to the game but more levels would be surely added as the time goes by.
Feel free to alter the game, by adding more interesting maps to the game world.</p>
